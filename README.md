Nutrition Website – Promoting Healthy Living Through Web Technology

This project is a user-focused nutrition website designed to encourage healthy eating habits through an interactive and visually engaging platform. The idea is to combine essential health tips, motivational content, and basic user interaction features in one place using only HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can log in or sign up with a clean and accessible form, view healthy food replacements, and get daily inspiration through food quotes and diet tips. 
The site also includes a lightweight Python server (server.py) to simulate basic user authentication, demonstrating how front-end interfaces can be connected with server logic. The project highlights how even a small, static site can deliver valuable functionality by leveraging the core principles of web development. It’s a perfect foundation for health-focused web apps, and can easily be expanded into a dynamic platform with meal planning, nutrient tracking, or personalized health insights using backend technologies. This idea promotes not only technical learning but also social good by encouraging healthy lifestyle choices through accessible web design.
